    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These buttermilk pumpkin pancakes are especially great for cold fall/winter mornings! Serve with syrup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk in buttermilk, pumpkin, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until well blended. </li>
        <li>Spray a large nonstick griddle or skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Pour batter by scant 1/3 cupfuls into the hot skillet, working in batches.
